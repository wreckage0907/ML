My first Machine Learning (ML) Project - CV AND CNN
This code is specifically developed to handle two separate datasets of images: one for identifying harmful objects in a household and another for harmless objects. By leveraging the power of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the code trains on these datasets to accurately classify objects as either harmful or harmless. The ultimate goal is to provide an automated system capable of distinguishing potential risks within a household environment.

My second ML project - Regression Model project 
This code is developed to take in data of a factory where all the information about the carbon monoxide level is given and the model is devoloped using a Pre Trained Regression model Called XGBoost to improvise the accuracy of a normal linear regression
